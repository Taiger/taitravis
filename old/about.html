                <p>Something very like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I had to return to Maybury that night. &nbsp;I was even afraid that that last fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from Mars. &nbsp;I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be in at the death.</p>
                <p>It was nearly eleven when I started to return. &nbsp;The night was unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my cousins' house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as the day. &nbsp;Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath stirred the shrubs about us. &nbsp;My cousins' man lit both lamps. &nbsp;Happily, I knew the road intimately. &nbsp;My wife stood in the light of the doorway, and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. &nbsp;Then abruptly she turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good hap.</p>
